<div class="two_third last"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #222222;">The people who make history are the ones who not only give their life to their career but also give their career a new life. When the career is that of a poet, every step is a risk. Kumar Vishwas is one such poet who has gifted himself an era of such a popularity which other poets cant&#8217;t even dream of. It has been possible only because he possesses the courage, wit and perseverance required to tame one&#8217;s destiny. The beginning of his poetic career was nothing short of a blind aim. It takes great deal of pluckiness to drop the course of engineering and pursue the passion of literature against the will of one&#8217;s family. He did all this to dedicate himself entirely to literature and rest is history. It has been more than a decade of his professional life as a poet and his charm is only increasing with each passing second.<blockquote class="">Koi Deewana Kehta Hai, Koi Paagal Samajhta Hai; Magar Dharti Ki Baicheni Ko Bas Baadal Samajhta Hai</blockquote></span><span style="color: #222222;"> </span></div><div class="clearboth"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His most celebrated couplet made him the heartthrob of the youth and established him as the most renowned and celebrated Indian poet. His grip over romanticism, flavored with his wit makes him stand apart but is not merely confined to it. The treasures that his pen has yielded cover wide range of notions viz., social issues, atrocities against women and women empowerment, philosophies of life and also those brimming with patriotic fervor. Collectively speaking, his poems are a mirror to society. He writes and sings his poems on stage with a bleeding passion. Few of his poems has also been recorded as songs encapsulated in albums. He is also serving as a lyricist in the Bollywood industry. For a Bollywood project, his verse has been recorded in the voice of none other than Asha Bhosle. He has broken the stereotypes and has not merely confined himself to writing poems and stage shows. He is also active in social media, constantly writing and commenting on the happenings in the society. There is a huge fan following of his wit among the netizens as well. He has been conferred with many poetic laurels and is an elite name in the field of Hindi literature. His achievements make him incredible and he stands unrivaled since years. Hindi literature owes a lot to him for writing a new saga in the field of poetry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="seperator" style="text-align: justify;"></div>

<h2><span style="font-family: bookman old style;">Prolific Performer</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://kumarvishwas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Bio-21.jpg"><img class="wp-image-914 size-medium alignright" src="http://kumarvishwas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Bio-21-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" /></a> Mesmerizer, Charmer, Spell caster and other such adjectives have been frequently used for him. Kumar Vishwas is a poet who went beyond the stereotypical norms of &#8216;Kavi Sammelan&#8217; or poetic functions and made it a performer&#8217;s stage. He has mastered and excelled in all aspects in whatever he has done. He has constantly been the first choice for national and international stages.

<blockquote class="">Tab Ik Pagli Ladki Ke Bin Jeena Gaddari Lagta Hai</p>
<p>Par Us Pagli Ladki Ke Bin Marna Bhi Bhari Lagta Hai</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The strength of the crowd that turns up in his concerts, marks the huge amount of popularity he has among youths. Until Kumar Vishwas arrived in this field, it was believed that the youth is no longer interested in Hindi literature and is mainly concentrated around rock concerts. He proved this cynical notion wrong by enticing huge crowd to his concerts. His fans includes people from all ages across the globe. Many people cherish his couplets and their music library consists of his collections. He has written and sung many verses, yet &#8216;Koi deewana kehta hai&#8230;.&#8217; remains to be the prior demand of public. His popularity can be guessed by the fact that his audiences sing his verses with him. His videos are a big hit on You Tube and he is a widely searched celebrity by the netizens. His solo concerts are as popular as his other ventures among the masses. He is the highest paid and busiest poet of the nation since years. His popularity remains unrivaled and ever increasing and is a culminated outcome of his devotion towards his passion. He has overcome all hurdles and gained a fan following and acclaim of unquestionable spirits. The number is just increasing as the mesmerizer continues to entice the crowd and command the popularity.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><blockquote class="">Hum Hain Desi Haan Magar,<br />
Har Desh Me Chhaye Hain Hum</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He has always been highly sensitive towards the welfare of the society and progress of the nation.

<p align="justify"><i>"Dr Kumar Vishwas defies his young age when it comes to poetic maturity. His presence on a kavi-sammelan stage makes it sparkle. He is a poet with velvet voice, unparallel style, extreme poetic sense and super satires. His poetry as well as his presentation take the audiences on a new high.
